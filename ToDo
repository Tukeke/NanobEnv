- Integrate weechat with the contacts manager
    - With a "call" command that can be configured to use different drivers
    - Add to weechat the fifo stuff
- Document that Q in mutt searches the abook-googlepowered contact list.
- Make notifications:
    - I'd centralize this on the weechat window, then make tmux bells.
        - Launch to fifo when new mail is received (i'll need a watcher for that)
        - Launch to fifo when an event is received (i'll need to configure calcurse to work on daemon mode)
