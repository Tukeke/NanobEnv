PIMShit
=======

Your console personal information manager

Pimshit aims to group all your best and favourite console tools into a simple tool.

This is achieved by
    - Making console PIM-related aplications work togheter nicely
    - Making a big wrapper directory, where all files should be stored (easy to backup!)
    - Making it work on the cloud (with google tools right now)

Pimshit provides
    - Google Calendar integration
    - Google Contacts integration
    - Gmail integration
    - Nice wizards for first configs
    - Solarized colors for almost everything
    - Integration with bitlbee
      - (planned): calls with gtalksms
      - (planned): See your contacts information from google contacts
    - (planned): ToDo list sync with google calendar

This way you've got:
    - Calendar
      - With reminders
    - Contacts
      - Integrated with bitlbee IM
    - Mail
      - With a nice sidebar and labels
    - Social Networks (bitlbee provides)
    - Calling contacts (gtalksms)
    - ToDo lists
perfectly integrated into one tool

TODO: add colors for nice cmus.
